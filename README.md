# GeoFence Analysis with AWS Athena and Folium

## Project Description:
GeoFence Analysis with AWS Athena and Folium is a comprehensive data science project aimed at analyzing geographic data using advanced techniques. Leveraging the power of AWS Athena for data querying and Folium for interactive map visualization, this project offers insights into geographical patterns and distances within specified regions.

## Key Features

### Geographic Data Analysis 
- The project utilizes AWS Athena, a serverless interactive query service, to efficiently query and retrieve geographic data stored in Amazon S3. By leveraging SQL queries, it extracts relevant information necessary for further analysis.

### Haversine Formula Implementation 
- The code incorporates the Haversine formula, a fundamental concept in geospatial analysis, to calculate distances between given coordinates and points of interest. This formula accurately measures distances over a sphere, making it ideal for geographic applications.

### Interactive Map Visualization 
- Using Folium, a powerful Python library for creating interactive maps, the project visualizes geographic data in an intuitive and interactive manner. It enables users to explore spatial relationships and patterns with ease.

### Customizable Radius Threshold 
- Users have the flexibility to define a radius threshold, allowing them to adjust the scope of analysis based on their specific requirements. This feature enhances the versatility of the project for various use cases.

### Effortless Deployment
- The project streamlines the process of saving results by providing options to save both the interactive map and analyzed data to local files. This ensures easy access to insights generated from the analysis.

## Technical Details

### AWS Integration
- The project seamlessly integrates with AWS services, including AWS Athena and Amazon S3, to access and process large-scale geographic datasets. It demonstrates the power of cloud computing in handling big data analytics tasks.

### Python Libraries 
- The project leverages popular Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and Folium for map visualization. These libraries offer extensive functionality and ease of use, making them ideal choices for data science projects.

### Geospatial Analysis: 
- Through the implementation of the Haversine formula, the project conducts geospatial analysis to calculate distances between coordinates. This technique is crucial for various applications, including location-based services and geographic proximity analysis.

### User Interaction
- The project incorporates user input for specifying geographic coordinates and radius thresholds, enabling customization of analysis parameters. This interactive approach enhances user experience and facilitates exploratory data analysis.
